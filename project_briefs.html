        <h2>Project 1 - Representation</h2>
        <p>Programming is a form of self-expression, a way to represent the world you see through your eyes - like painting, poetry, or architecture. And just like those endeavors it comes with its own set of requirements, opportunities, and limitations. The goal of this project is to explore these opportunities and limitations by comparing programming with over forms of self-expression. We'll create representations of a natural phenomenon in different media, compare them, and find was to engage our imagination in representing it. It could take the form of a "what if" scenario, a metaphor, a re-imagination or juxtaposition - yours is the poetic license.</p>
        <h2>Project 2 - Control</h2>
        <p>The underlying purpose of any interface is control. User's wishes mapped onto the system's capabilities. This project focuses on the structure of this mapping, from the micro-scale (a single point of interaction), to medium - feature list, layout, to macro - modularity and customization. We'll explor micro-interactions, contextual controls, gestalt principles in interface design and the underlying system capabilities that could afford a set of interface options.</p>
        <h2>Project 3 - Communication</h2>
        <p>The ability to communicate is at the very core of what makes us human - and we imparted this skill on our machines as well. The Internet of Things - as overused as this term is - means that ANY machine with electronic circuitry would be able to communicate. The Internet is the language and data is its grammar. The role of a designer is akin to that of an interpreter - making it easier for humans to talk to machines. In this project we will work with collecting and transmitting data, as well as representing it in the form of a dashboard. </p>
