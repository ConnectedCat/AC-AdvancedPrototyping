        <h3>Project 1: prototyping representation.</h3>
        <p>Programming is a form of self-expression, a way to represent the world you see through your eyes - like painting, poetry, or architecture. And just like those endeavors it comes with its own set of requirements, opportunities, and limitations. The goal of this project is to explore these opportunities and limitations by comparing programming with over forms of self-expression. We'll create representations of a natural phenomenon in different media, compare them, and find was to engage our imagination in representing it. It could take the form of a "what if" scenario, a metaphor, a re-imagination or juxtaposition - yours is the poetic license.</p>

            <h4>Week 1: Sept. 13</h4>

            <h5>In-class:</h5>
            <p>Introduction to class. GitHub as a coding platform. Using diagrams as a tool for communication and visual thinking.</p>

            <h5>Homework:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Come up with a natural system you'd like to represent in code: sun moving across the sky, a bunch of ants on a table, etc. The system need to have several moving components.</li>
                <li>Create a diagram of the system that would show the following: All components of the system (including the user interacting with it); The property of each component - what are they like? The roles of each component - what do they do? The relationships of the components - how do they affect each other?</li>
                <li>Here is <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lDk48Mw=/" target="_blank">an example of a UML diagram of a pond as a system.</a></li>

            <h4>Week 2: Sept. 20</h4>

            <h5>In-class:</h5>
            <p>Homework reviews - diagam discussions.  Translating diagrams into code. Modelling natural systems in code.</p>

            <h5>Homework:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Continue working on you systems based on the feedback you received during class: focus on translating your diagrams in to code within a Processing sketch.</li>
                <li>Figure out how interactive elements could be embedded and which aspects of the system could be controlled via mouse and/or keyboard</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Week 3: Sept. 27</h4>

            <h5>In-class:</h5>
            <p>In-class: code review, group critique.</p>

            <h5>Homework:</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Read <a href="http://blogs.ischool.berkeley.edu/ict4se/files/2010/09/Prototypes_prototype.pdf" target="_blank">Stephanie Houde and Charles Hill, What do Prototypes Prototype?</a>. Pick 3 quotes from the text and write 1 paragraph response for each quote. Post on GitHub.</li>
                <li>Polish your Project 1 and create a blog post on your GitHub featuring a lot of images (and/or videos) from the project and responses for the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Why did you decide to work on this topic, what's your interest there?</li>
                        <li>- How did you envision your system in the beginning and how did that vision change?</li>
                        <li>- At least one image of your diagram.</li>
                        <li>- How did you translate your diagram into code?</li>
                        <li>- How did you deal with the complexity in your system?</li>
                        <li>- How did you decide on the interactive elements?</li>
                        <li>- What would be some paths for future development of the project?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Make sure you have the hardware you'll need for the next project: refer to <a href="materials.html" target="_blank">the list of matrials.</a></li>
