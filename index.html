            <h3>Workshop 1: Generative animation</h3>
            <p>Create an animation that shows a clock for aliens. The clock cannot display time tied to the rotation of the Earth - years, months, days, hours, minutes, etc. Instead create your own system of time - however large or small. If the clock is no longer tied to celestial movement - how else can you express the passing of time? Would the time be continuous or discrete? Cyclical or unidirectional? How would you divide it into sub-elements and what visual tools would you use to represent distinctions: color, shape, size, order?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>use arrays and loops</li>
                <li>use rotation with the transformation matrix</li>
                <li>use either trigonometric functions or intervals (or both if need be)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You will showcase your work at the end of the workshop and submit your Processing sketch and the URL to the documentation the week after. The documentation should be focused on the creative and problem solving process, so take pictures and videos as you work, and include code snippets for illustration.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>classes should contain all properties and methods relevant to the entity represented</li>
                <li>the collection of objects should be maintained as an ArrayList</li>
                <li>mouse or keyboard interaction should pass some data to the object it is acting upon</li>

            <h3>Workshop 2: Interactive Simulation</h3>
            <p>Create a sketch that would simulate an existing natural system - look at physics, biology, and other natural sciences for good examples. Start with the environment - where is the system situated? What are the forces the environment might exert on the system? Examine the agents in the system, their relationships to each other and the environment they are in. The look at how this system would develop over time. What are the rules that you are going to come up with, what are the parameters you are going to feed into them and what effect will the changes have on the development of the system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>create classes of entities to represent the components of the system</li>
                <li>use vectors to represent forces existing in the system</li>
                <li>use randomness or noise to generate at least one</li>
                <li>add direct or indirect mouse or keyboard controls</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You will showcase your work at the end of the workshop and submit your Processing sketch and the URL to the documentation the week after.</p>
