            <h3>Week 4</h3>
            <h4>Workshop 1: Generative animation</h4>
            <p>Create an animation that shows a clock for aliens. The clock cannot display time tied to the rotation of the Earth - years, months, days, hours, minutes, etc. Instead create your own system of time - however large or small. If the clock is no longer tied to celestial movement - how else can you express the passing of time? Would the time be continuous or discrete? Cyclical or unidirectional? How would you divide it into sub-elements and what visual tools would you use to represent distinctions: color, shape, size, order?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>use arrays and loops</li>
                <li>use rotation with the transformation matrix</li>
                <li>use either trigonometric functions or intervals (or both if need be)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You will showcase your work at the end of the workshop and submit your Processing sketch and the URL to the documentation the week after. The documentation should be focused on the creative and problem solving process, so take pictures and videos as you work, and include code snippets for illustration.</p>

            <h3>Week 7</h3>
            <h4>Workshop 2: Interactive Simulation</h4>
            <p>Create a sketch that would simulate an existing natural system - look at physics, biology, and other natural sciences for good examples. Start with the environment - where is the system situated? What are the forces the environment might exert on the system? Examine the agents in the system, their relationships to each other and the environment they are in. The look at how this system would develop over time. What are the rules that you are going to come up with, what are the parameters you are going to feed into them and what effect will the changes have on the development of the system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>create classes of entities to represent the components of the system</li>
                <li>use vectors to represent forces existing in the system</li>
                <li>use randomness or noise to generate at least one</li>
                <li>add direct or indirect mouse or keyboard controls</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You will showcase your work at the end of the workshop and submit your Processing sketch and the URL to the documentation the week after.</p>

            <p>To start getting familiar with the Arduino IDE and the process of uploading and running code on Arduino boards please experiment with creating different patterns of blinking LED. You can use Morse code, you can try to recreate a musical rhythm, or any other familiar patters. Create 3 of those rhythmic patterns, capture them on video and upload the video as a media recording, and the 3 .ino files as a ZIP archive here.</p>

            </ul>

            <h4>Homework:</h4>
            <p>For your homework please create an interactive system consisting of Arduino-based hardware and Processing-based software. Use at least 3 hardware inputs in Arduino. Determine the usable ranges and send the data from your sensors to a Processing sketch via serial communication.</p>
            <p>On the Processing side first ensure clean and stable serial communication and usable values. Then re-map the data you'll be getting from you sensors to some visual parameters in your sketch. Positions of objects, colors, sizes, speed of movements, etc - are all good examples of such parameters. Each parameter comes with it's own reasonable range so put some thought into a re-mapping process.</p>
            <p>Experiment with the application of the 3 values we're getting from Arduino. See where you can plug them in to achieve interesting graphic results. Get creative by picking a theme or making an animated illustration - look at modern and contemporary art for inspiration.</p>
            <p>Capture the results on video, upload zip files with your Arduino and Processing files along with the videos.</p>

            <p>For next week please create an enclosure with an Arduino and a mounted LCD screen connected to the Arduino. Using various inputs: buttons, sound or light sensors, potentiometers, serial input from Processing - the choice is yours - create a system capable of registering at least 3 states (see <a title="Program mode" href="https://online.smc.edu/courses/45606/pages/program-mode" data-api-endpoint="https://online.smc.edu/api/v1/courses/45606/pages/program-mode" data-api-returntype="Page">Program mode</a>) and communicating them to a user through the messages on the display.</p>

            <h3>Week 11</h3>
            <h4>Workshop 3: Game controller</h4>
            <p>Make a game. You can choose one of the three simple genres: ping-pong, runner or shooter - or create your own. It needs to have a scoring system and a failure state. Win state is not required - it could be just a game for the score, but it's certainly a possibility. Create a world and a story for the game, clearly outline the goals and the scoring system for the players.</p>
            <p>Make a custom controller for the game. Think primarily about the layout and the functions of the sensors. How does the physical interaction with the controller translate to the graphical representation of the movement on the screen? What kind of mental model will the user form about the constraints and possibilities in the game? Will you controller support or hinder the movements? Consider the player's position: the body posture, the hands orientation, the reach of the fingers, the comfortable speed or motion, etc. Use cardboard and mounting materials (thread, wire, etc.) to assemble your electronics.</p>
            <p>Record the game-play on video and create a documentation page online with the description of the controller, and the responses to the questions in the brief.</p>
